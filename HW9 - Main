Just as we did for some of the data structures, we will implement our own sort method.

Add code to time the execution of each sort test you do; print out the elapsed time of each run.

Add sufficient test cases to determine the Big-Oh:  summarize your findings with comments in your code including the times of each run. (Make sure it still compiles and runs after these changes)

Follow instructions from class; use the starter code here. Turn in your final working code here.
