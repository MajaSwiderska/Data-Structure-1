Assignment to be started in class, and then finished afterwards......

Work from the instructions given in class. Start and rename SetNodeStarter to be SetNode as you begin (use Refactor > Rename). Complete the TO DOs in the program and including extending and completing the SetNodeStarter code.  

See the TODOs in both files provided.

DO NOT USE RECURSION.  DO NOT LOOK UP OTHER SOLUTIONS ON THE WEB, AI, etc. You need to follow the structure provided.  This will require good THINKING BEFORE PROGRAMMING!!

Questions on the methods and what they need to do?  See the SET interface documentation, of course!

Turn in your two .java files here AND a screen shot of your output from running the test program after all changes are made successfully
