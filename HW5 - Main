Follow instructions from class.  Turn in two  .java files here: MyArrayList.java and MyArrayTeaster.java .

Unless updated in class, you need to:

Complete the code from the starter provided: finish the Starter code attached. 
finish set method 
finish get method 
finish set method 
finish the test code 
Test your code with a suitable test class
Remember- you are a good OOP designer.  Keep good encapsulation. Use standard Java doc comments.  Identify constructors, mutators, accessors. Not required but always a good idea = draw UML class diagram(s)
