Follow instructions from class.  Turn in you .java files here: MyArrayListGeneric.java and MyArrayListGenericTester.java.

The To Do if not finished during class: 

Implement Generics <E>
rewrite : add() method, set() method, get() method implementing Generics
Remove(int index) method 
IndexOf(E o) method 
Contains(E o) method 
Test the three methods - remove(), indexOf(), contains()  You can still let it end with an exception when a call is made with index our of bounds.
Remember- you are a good OOP designer.  Keep good encapsulation. Include correct and complete Java doc comments for each method.  Not required but always useful: draw an UML class diagram.
